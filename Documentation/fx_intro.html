            <h2>Understanding the FX Class</h2>
            <h4>What is the FX Class?</h4>
            <p>
                More generally, what is a Class? In PHP you can write a little program that has its own functions and
                its own variables; it&apos;s called a Class. It&apos;s an object that you can instantiate and use
                whenever you want. If that&apos;s clear, you can move on; if not, keep going. You can think of a class
                as as specific type of object in the world around you: like a seasoned developer, a man-eating beast, a
                nose, or a foot.  Each of these has functions (things they can do) like smell, and variables (attributes)
                like size and color. Objects of the same class will have the same functions &mdash; developers will have a
                writeCode() function &mdash; though their attributes will likely vary somewhat. As you program, it&apos;s
                important to keep in mind that although objects of <em>different</em> classes may have functions with the
                same name, they might do quite different things (compare the smell() functions of a nose and a foot, for
                example.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual FX object, or class, is written in a document called FX.php. That document is in the folder
                that you downloaded, and is why you have to put this directory on your web server to &quot;install&quot;
                FX.
            </p>
            <h4>How does FX talk to FileMaker Pro?</h4>
            <p>
                You could talk to FileMaker Pro yourself using any web browser by typing the URL that connects you to
                your host (for example, fmserver.mydomain.com or 192.168.1.11), then adding onto the URL specific,
                FileMaker-defined, WPE&sup1; syntax. The WPE&sup1; syntax and how to use it can be found in the
                FileMaker&reg; Pro documentation on Custom Web Publishing with XML.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use WPE&sup1; syntax in the URL &mdash; for example to perform a find &mdash; your web browser
                will connect to the server, authenticate, and load the results. The returned data, however, is formatted
                in XML and contains all sorts of other metadata beyond what you might have expected from your original
                query.
            </p>
            <p>
                The FX class simplifies this. Giving you PHP functions very similar in name to their FileMaker&reg; Pro
                counterparts, it builds the URL query for you, sends it to the server, and then parses the XML results
                into a beautiful PHP array.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don’t have to know FileMaker URL syntax to use the FX Class. You don’t have to know XML. You never
                have to leave the PHP environment.
            </p>
            <h4>How do I use the FX Class?</h4>
            <p>
                The rest of this &quot;Getting Started&quot; section shows a simple PHP script that performs a
                find on your data source of choice using the FX Parser. Use of the FX Class is explained briefly here,
                with enough details to get you started. For more detail see the <a href="functions.html">functions
                documentation</a>.
