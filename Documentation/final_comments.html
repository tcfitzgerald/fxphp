            <h3>Using the FX Parser From Here On</h3>
            <p>
                You may find that no matter how familiar you become with PHP, FX, and your data sources of choice, there
                are times when troubleshooting is difficult and complicated. The FX Parser is a good tool to keep at hand
                because it is abstracted from the HTML and control logic of your project. Pasting just your FX code into
                the Parser gives you a quick and dirty look at PHP/database behavior, and you can quickly see if the
                problem is the FX / database combo, or somewhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                For FileMaker&reg; users, because the FX Parser utilizes the FMErrors.php file, you can still be
                benefited by viewing an error result set. You can drill down to see the back trace or view the error code
                and text to help troubleshoot the problem. Other options beyond the FX Parser are discussed in the
                <a href="best_practices.html">Best Practices</a> portion of the documentation.
            </p>
            <h4>The FX Parser is Open</h4>
            <p>
                The FX Parser is free, and is distributed under the same artistic license as the FX Class. Any suggestions
                for modifications should be forwarded so that the tool can be of more use to the community. Please submit
                your changes or suggestions via the <a href="https://github.com/yodarunamok/fxphp/issues">issues
                interface</a> on github.
            </p>
            <h4>Thanks to the FX Team</h4>
            <p>
                Kudos to all who have made FX a working solution. PHP in combination with your data source is an
                outstanding and marketable asset. If you are new to dynamic web development you have found a worthy
                deployment method.
            </p>
            <p>
                The synergy of databases and PHP via FX will be ongoing. The tools and knowledge developed are most
                welcome in the community. Please share your thoughts, ideas and code with the rest of us on the
                <a href="http://www.iviking.org/mailman/listinfo/fx.php_list">FX.php mailing list</a>.
